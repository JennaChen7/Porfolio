<div class="main_content">
“Dad? They say that when people leave this world, they become stars.” She said. In a summer breeze, the purple flowers and green grass swayed gently around her. Behind, the galaxy, formed by billions of stars, was shining, falling into the dark horizon.<br>
“No, they don’t-” He laughed, trying to sweep away her fantasies.<br><br>
 
All of a sudden, he was awake and sat up abruptly. The scenes from the dream, however, dragged on and hesitated to fade away. In front of the old mottled wall-<br>
There she was, looking into the galaxy that he could neither see nor understand, smiling and half transparent.<br>
He held his breath subconsciously and concentrated and tried hard to retain his daughter. Please don’t go, he prayed silently, let her stay, my lord, just for a while. But a dream was never more than a dream; he blinked, and so it disappeared.<br><br>
 
For a little while, he stared at the cracks and dark spots on the wall, confused. Then, as if he came to realize something, he grabbed and threw the pillow off the bed, along with a pack of cigarettes; he fumbled for his phone in the dark. Picking it up, he called her and began to ramble before it was answered.<br>
How have you been recently? How is school? How… I just want to say that I missed you and I’m sorry that-<br>
The number you have dialed is not in service. You may hang up or…<br><br>
 
Why is she not picking up the phone? Why keep me… <br>
He dropped the phone on the bed and looked around the old room, the wall paints falling off and the floor half buried in the dirt. <br>
No.<br>
He slowly recalled-I buried her ashes, right, for how long had she been gone? It should be a bit over three, no, four years…
These years, as aging ate away his energy little by little, he dreamed more about the past rather than the days to come. Which is completely understandable, he thought, I used to have almost everything I ever fought for. And on some especially exhausting days, in the middle of the night, he woke up covered in sweats and forgot that she had been long gone. You have to move on, he sometimes told himself. Then, he wondered every time after that, where to? Toward what? And most importantly-
Why?<br>
 
The roll of toilet paper on the bedside cupboard fell on the wooden floor abruptly; he heard it rolling away quickly. For a while, he sat still on the bed with his head blank. Shortly after, he was suddenly angry and punched hard into the wall. Then, wiggling his fingers while pieces of white paint sticking on his knuckles, he frowned and swore, damn that hurts.
This is good, he thought, at least it flushed away some emotions. Real men don’t cry; his father wouldn’t be proud.
Tears ran down from his eyes, a few drops flowing into his mouth. It was salty. He wiped it, feeling disgusted. It must be because of the dazzling light of the phone screen, he thought, convincing himself. <br>
Picking up the pack of Black Mount on the floor, he lit up one, laid back onto the bed, and pulled slowly on his cigarette. He coughed-it was spicy and hard.<br>
Watching the smoke filling up the room slowly and gilding every matter around with whiteness, he asked silently-<br>
Why me?<br>
and then-<br>
What have I done?<br><br>
 
He yanked open the cupboard door, grabbed a pistol, pressed the muzzle hard on his temple, and pulled the trigger-<br>
Once.<br>
Twice.<br>
Three times.<br>
Until his hand got a cramp and became too quivery to pull again. Staring at the grain of dust falling off it and floating and swirling and colliding into each other in the air, he laughed; he never loaded that pistol. How funny. He then pulled out a mag and loaded it reluctantly, but this time he straightened his arm and held it as far from himself as possible. Adjusting the pistol in his hand continuously, he frowned, hesitated, and failed to gather enough courage to move it any closer to himself.<br>
Staring at the reflection of the mottled, broken moonlight on the barrel, he gave up.<br>
It was quiet. And then he noticed that there was a tear on the curtain a few inches away from his hand. <br>
It was quite a large tear-he could see the streetlight outside through it. Using his fingers to tear it larger, he then began to poke the pistol into the hole until he could only see the trigger and grip. After that, he slowly loosened his hands with caution, leaving the pistol dangling on the curtain.<br><br>
 
If it falls off before I come back, then I should die tonight...<br><br>
 
On the rooftop, he lit up another cigarette and looked up at the stars. <br>
Aren’t they pretty? She used to say.<br><br>
 
He never understood why people would spend minutes looking at the sky-to him, the stars always looked like white dandruff stuck in women’s black hair. And yet she said they looked like glitters and are souls of the deceased. <br>
Then, he thought, she must be among the stars. Looking over the sky and examining those stars carefully, he found one that was the most bright and conspicuous. And so he decided that it must be his daughter.<br>
For quite a while, he stared at it, watching it twinkling.<br>
Then he looked away and tossed the cigarette. When he looked up at the night sky again, he couldn’t find his star, his daughter. He searched again and again until his eyes hurt and his head dizzy, but she was not within his sight anymore.<br><br>
 
It’s time to move on.<br>
Where to?<br>
It does not have to be anywhere, as long as there is somewhere to go.<br>
Toward what?<br>
It does not have to be toward anything.<br>
Why?<br>
He hesitated, then answered to himself-<br>
Because I want to do so.<br><br>
 
Suddenly felt ashamed, he slapped himself hard and left the rooftop.<br>
In the chaotic and dirty bedroom, he looked to the curtain; the pistol was no longer hanging there. <br>
He stared at it, and then throw himself onto the bed.<br>
Maybe next time, he thought. <br>
