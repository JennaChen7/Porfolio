<div class="main_content">
“Was it you who sneaked out twenty cents from the brown box? Was it you?” My step-father yelled at me in anger. He walked close very quickly, his worn cotton-padded shoes treading on the mottled, cracked floor, trailing small clouds of dust each time he lifted his foot. Esperanza, my sister, timid and tender, stood in the corner silently with her head lowered. 
“I didn’t...” I made the rest of my explanation vanish between the lips, trembling, as he pulled a thick leather belt from his waist, folded it in half,  and pointed it to my face. I could feel the breeze brought by it on my nose tip as it swang slowly. <br>
“How dare you to make up an excuse, and...and being this disrespectful to me?”<br>
“...” His belt lashed down on the ground on my right side. <br>
“Answer me!” He yelled, raised the belt again, unaware of the fact that he didn’t ask any questions. <br>
I closed my eyes, waiting to be whipped quietly. <br>
I knew there’s no other way out. I knew he wasn’t interested in listening to any reasons. I knew he simply wanted to hit me to emphasize that he and I are not equal.<br>
“I stole the twenty cents.” Suddenly, I heard my sister’s voice, trembling, scared, yet obstinate, echoing in the void, shabby house like sad bird songs from the last autumn morning before winter.<br><br>

Probably because I was too scared, or because the groundless excuse blurted out by my sister made my step-father’s action pause a bit, I ran toward the door with my legs trembling and my arms numb.<br>
And then the next second when I managed to collect all my consciousness chips from corners of the mind, I noticed myself to be on the street with my feet in slippers buried in snow.<br>
Winter given birth by the deep north is always excruciatingly cold and dark. The road in the front was narrow and covered in snow, and as the pale moonlight, the only illumination in this sleeping old town, shined on it, it disguised itself as a plain, sacred path, luring the pedestrians to step through the glowing surface into sunken grounds filled with putrid mud. The tall trees along the street, while rustling in the wind, saluted for those beneath their shadows; and occasionally when they looked up,  the withered branches with strange wizened fruits hanging and birds’ nests, while full of holes, teetering among the twigs, would slice up the black velvet-like sky silently into irregular shapes. <br>
Everything in this small town where I lived all my life was cold, strangely unfamiliar, and dark.<br>
Where were the tiles on rooftops gilded with red, warm light from a setting sun?<br>
Where were the locust trees with little pinkish-white flowers exuding fragrance among the green leaves?<br>
The wind mingled with snow, the breath of winter, blew through my body in a short-sleeved shirt, taking away the burning sensations from the feet and hands and turning them numb. <br>
It was like a cure, only not curing.<br>
So I began to stumble on the potholed, rutted road, bargaining a little warmness with the winter. <br>
I forgot that the very existence of this child of the north is a blessing, a gift from God,  bringing a peaceful cease to almost every life form; without an end, there could never be a beginning; without death, one is never alive.<br>
Running didn’t stop the loss of feelings. Numbness climbed up the limbs slowly, inch by inch, taking away coldness and pain blandly and leaving a sensation of warmness, intermittent and vague. <br>

Sometimes I fell. <br>
Where were my slippers? <br>
I didn’t know. I couldn’t feel them on my bare feet.<br>
I noticed blood (or mud?) on my right hand.<br>
Was it from the legs or was my hand cut?<br>
Did I fall on pieces of green glass from beer bottles, rusty iron wires, or aluminum pull tabs that they threw on the ground?
I didn’t know.<br>
I never noticed the very end of myself to be such close, pressing, and inevitable. I couldn’t run away from something lying on my path of future, waiting, so I stopped running.<br>
And for a moment, I stood amidst the snowstorm, confused. I saw nothing but thick, opaque darkness with shatters of snowflakes gleaming in the hazy moonlight. I felt nothing but my heart beating, stubbornly hitting against the ribs as if trying to escape.<br>
Thump, thump, thump… <br>
Where was my path?<br>
Thump, thump, thump…<br>
The cease was coming, between one heartbeat and the next one.<br>
Thump, thump, thump…<br>
In a trance, I turned into a plump orange cat, lying on a piece of round wool rug, right next to a fireplace with fire burning and faggot woods cracking. It gazed into the red flames with glass-like eyes, its pupils contracting to a thin line. The flames, like liquid silk or solid smoke, tangling and diffusing and merging into each other, covered everything else near in a thin, warm amber mist. <br>
Then the surroundings seemed to tear and fade away, the broken pieces whitening and turning into faint, sparkling snow.<br>
Until-<br>
All of a sudden, something, or someone, bumped into me. I went weak in the knees and fell into the snow. I heard her fell too. Then I was pulled up. <br>
“I… I’m so sorry… I… Perdita? Perry! It’s really you… Oh thank God you’re ok!” Her voice was hoarse, incoherent, yet familiar among the unfamiliar surroundings.<br>

It’s Essie.
<br><br><br>








...I felt a hand on my shoulder, the pressure and warmness dragging me through the gate connecting the unconscious and the conscious. I struggled, refused to return. I was an inch away from being at true peace, and the next moment he pulled me away from it. <br>
From my blessing.<br><br> 

How dare you alter my path so arbitrarily?<br>
How dare you play God?<br>
How dare you?<br><br>

And so I was back to reality and stood right after my end, on a different path.<br>
I tried to open my eyes; they seemed to be heavy, almost impossible to move. I’ve had enough darkness tonight, I thought, I’ve read stories where people got badly injured, passed out and woke up, and did not have much strength.<br>
I’m probably experiencing the same thing.<br>
Then I felt something cold in my eyes, followed by a sharp pain.<br>
Probably not.<br>
I’m pretty sure a snowflake just fell on my eyeballs.<br><br>

“Thank God she’s ok! Honey, honey? How’s the other girl? Is she ok? ” The man asked, uneasy and anxious. <br>
The wind blew, carrying no words from the other person.<br>
“Honey?”<br>
After a moment.<br>
“I...I don’t...I don’t know, ” I heard a woman’s voice several steps away, “she’s not...breathing I think...I’m not sure...Oh God!”<br>
Whom else did they hit? My mind was blank for a moment, then all the pieces of memory began to flash:<br>
A girl in a shabby pink coat.<br>
Snowflakes falling from the clouds.<br>
A bim of light.<br><br>

Wait, where’s Essie?<br><br>

I heard the man walked away, his boots pressed into the snow, making an unpleasant sound. <br>
“Can’t feel her pulse...It’s wet here...Wait, let me get my phone.”<br>
The footsteps came close, then a little away again.<br>
“Oh God! Oh my God! What...what? Oh!” The woman cried out, gasping quickly, as if she’s going to faint. <br>
For a while, they were trying hard to breathe, cold air, carrying oxygen, flowing away from them.<br><br>

Why are they panicking?<br>

“Ummm, we should call someone...call the ambulance! Quickly, call them!” The man jabbered, bewildered. <br>
“Yeah, yes we… we should call the ambulance...hold on...” <br>
I heard her reaching into her pocket for her phone, her sleeve rubbing against her thick down jacket.<br>
Then the sound vanished.<br>
She suddenly stopped.<br>
“Maybe...”She said vaguely, paused, “Maybe...”<br>
“What?”<br>
“We...we could leave them there...”<br>
“What? What are you talking about?” He said, seemingly shocked.<br>
“I mean...we could...No, no, no… I mean no one would find out we did it, right? That...this road is off the map and...and there are no cameras...”<br>
“Hey! What...what are you saying? They are just kids! Look at her! She’s probably eight, at most ten...The other kid is even younger...and...”He began to pace back and forth, hesitating.<br>
“Stop and look at me!” She cried out desperately, grabbed him, dragging him toward the car, their boots trading heavily through the snow, into the mud under it, “Look over there!” Her voice hoarse and cracking,<br>
“Look into the car! That’s your son! If you take these kids to the hospital, we will be murderers! We will have to pay the medical fees which we cannot afford...So, so...we won’t have the money to treat his cancer! Your son! You will lose your son in several months! You will murder your own son! Will you take his life? Will you? ”<br>
“Shut up! Of course I will not!”<br><br>
…<br><br>
“Alright.”<br>
I felt like falling, through the snow, through the frozen soil, through this winter, into somewhere even colder.<br><br>

I don't understand.<br>
He saved me, and then left me to die.<br>
Why?<br>
If they never found Essie, will they take me to the hospital?<br>
If Essie has never gone out of the house, will I survive?<br>
I don't want to die. I want to live.<br>
I hate them. I want them died.<br>
I hate Essie. I wish that she was beaten to death by our stepfather.<br>
I would have lived.<br><br>

The man walked close slowly, took off his coat, and placed it over my body.<br>
He sighed.<br>
''You should wear more in a weather like this.''<br>
He paused.<br>
''I'm sorry.''<br><br>

And then they left. The three-year-old boy lowered the car window and looked outside. He coughed and blinked amidst shiny snowflakes. His eyesight fell on the little girl several feet away, smiled, and pointed at her with his little fingers:
''Papa, did you bring me a friend?''<br>
'' Yes, yes...sit and we're leaving.''<br>
''Papa, don't leave her here. I like her and can we play together?''<br>
The little boy blinked, his eyes were very bright as if they were stars of a summer night, distant yet filled with hope.
That night, Perdita crawled and looked for her sister and cried. <br>
Her hands finally touched something wet. <br>
She didn't recognize it.<br><br>

A little girl sat on the ground covered in snow, her eyes opening widely, gazing into the darkness. Her right hands reached out into a bunch of red and white matters. Next to her, her sister lied there. <br>
I wasn't quite sure if it's my sister.<br>
Couldn't see her face.<br>
Then I fainted.<br><br>

The cat wandered into the deepest winter with the girl who adopted it.<br>
It followed her closely, fearing she would disappear with the blink of an eye.<br>
It blinked, and so she disappeared.<br>
And so wind and snow became its only company.<br>
